# SM-S908B / S908BXXSMGZB2 source provenance

This directory carries the source provenance for the hardware-tested
`SM-S908B` / `S908BXXSMGZB2` payload.

## Provenance

- Upstream: `sarabpal-dev/IonStack-S22U`
- Base commit: `2b4e8a64b78d18f236f0d5b26cfd204bc46363ce`
- Target used for the validated rebuild: `S908BXXSMGZB2`
- Reproduction toolchain: Android NDK r28c (`28.2.13676358`)
- Main payload API: 35
- Embedded ARM32 API: 28
- Payload SHA-256: `19a219a94660a60c06a4c34f9a873b5c9ccacda7129d409ba8486ffe61453235`
- Embedded ARM32 stage SHA-256: `023190461719fc4cc11a7d114ff8da5132f1afa0eba32c907053e83682914152`

The nested `ionstack-s908b-gzb2/` tree preserves the build-relevant source
state that reproduced the hardware-tested payload byte-for-byte in private CI.
It intentionally retains the diagnostic and retry instrumentation present in
the validated binary; this contribution does not substitute a cleaned,
stripped, repadded, or merely behaviorally equivalent rebuild.

## Snapshot fidelity and inherited metadata

The source tree is intentionally not normalized after validation. In
particular, the inherited IonStack `README.md` still describes the earlier
SM-S908W/b0q target, and
`src/targets/S908BXXSMGZB2/target.h` retains an inherited
`BUILD_FINGERPRINT` string for that older target. The latter macro is not
referenced by the compiled source outside target headers; the validated target
label is `S908BXXSMGZB2`, and the hardware-proven payload does not contain the
legacy S908W fingerprint string.

The embedded ARM32 stage also retains the historical diagnostic banner
`CVE-2026-43499 32-bit ARM stage (b0q)`. That string is a provenance/debug
label, not a target-selection mechanism. It is present in the immutable
hardware-tested binary and is documented rather than rewritten, because
rewriting it would produce a different payload hash.

Those inherited metadata strings are documented rather than edited here so the
published source remains the same build state that was already reproduced and
validated. A future cleanup should be a separate change with a fresh rebuild
and validation, not a silent rewrite of this reference snapshot.

The original `.gitignore` from the pinned base commit is retained. The only
file omitted from the CI source snapshot is `MEMORY.md`, a non-build developer
notebook containing machine-local development paths. Its omission does not
change any build input.

## Integration scope

This source snapshot is supplied for reproducibility and review. It is **not**
wired into the repository top-level `Makefile` by this contribution, and this
contribution does not add an automatic support-feed entry. The validated scope
remains the exact `SM-S908B / S908BXXSMGZB2` build.

The modifications relative to the pinned upstream commit include the Root My
Galaxy root-helper handoff, cleanup/retry lifecycle changes, corrected GZB2
physical kernel load base, independent physical-KASLR slot resolution, and
separation of physical direct-map translation from the virtual KASLR slide.

## Deterministic rebuild

Use Android NDK r28c (`28.2.13676358`) on Linux x86_64. The source
Makefile prefers a host `arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc` for exp32 when one is available,
so the command below sets a deliberately unavailable `HOST_CC32` name and
thereby forces the exact NDK ARM32 compiler path used by the successful CI
reproduction. It also pins the NDK root/toolchain and disables Buildroot
selection.

Run from the upstream repository root after placing this source directory:

```sh
NDK=/absolute/path/to/android-ndk-r28c

env -u CC -u NDK_ROOT -u ANDROID_NDK_ROOT -u NDK_TOOLCHAIN \
  ANDROID_NDK_HOME="$NDK" \
  make -C src/targets/b0s-S908BXXSMGZB2/ionstack-s908b-gzb2 \
    PROJECT=S908BXXSMGZB2 \
    API=35 \
    API32=28 \
    NDK_ROOT="$NDK" \
    NDK_TOOLCHAIN="$NDK/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64" \
    HOST_CC32=__force_ndk_arm32__ \
    USE_BUILDROOT= \
    clean preload
```

Expected outputs:

```text
src/targets/b0s-S908BXXSMGZB2/ionstack-s908b-gzb2/
  build/S908BXXSMGZB2/bin/cve-2026-43499
  build/S908BXXSMGZB2/bin/cve-exp32
```

The rebuilt payload must have SHA-256:

```text
19a219a94660a60c06a4c34f9a873b5c9ccacda7129d409ba8486ffe61453235
```

The embedded `cve-exp32` stage must have SHA-256:

```text
023190461719fc4cc11a7d114ff8da5132f1afa0eba32c907053e83682914152
```

The source retains the upstream Apache-2.0 license. The modification summary
and inherited-metadata disclosure are contained in this README and in the
validation document under `docs/`.
